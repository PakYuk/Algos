/*You are given an integer n. Your task is to calculate how many times the digits 0, 2 and 4 appear in all the non-negative integers up to n(0,1,...,n ).

Example
• For n = 10 , the output should be count0ccurrences(n) = 4
  • The digit 0 appears in numbers 0 and 10 once, for a total of 2 occurrences,
  • The digit 2 appears in the number 2 once, for a total of 1 occurrence,
  • The digit 4 appears in the number 4 once, for a total of 1 occurrence.
  So the answer is 2 + 1 + 1 = 4
• For n = 22 , the output should be countOccurrences(n) = 11
  • The digit 0 appears in numbers 0, 10, and 20 once, for a total of 3 occurrences,
  • The digit 2 appears in numbers 2, 20, 22 once, for a total of 3 occurrence,
  • The digit 4 appears in the number 4, 14, once, for a total of 2 occurrence.
  So the answer is 3 + 3 + 2 = 8
